Rate tracker
============

Tracks the standard variable mortgage rate of high-street mortgage providers.

The standard variable mortgage rate is lender specific, some lenders base it 
on the Bank of England base rate, others use the LIBOR (London Intrabank
O? Rate), other use a combination or other factors. It is up to the lenders
themselves as to how they determine their own standard variable mortgage
rate. There are no fixed rules over how a lender's standard variable
rate is determined.

This hack attempts to monitor when the standard variable mortgage rate
changes, how fast moving banks are to increases and decreases in the
main base rates. And essentially to determine which lenders offer the
best standard variable rate.


The standard variable rate is the interest rate on a mortgage once the 
introductory offer period has expired right up until the end of the mortgage.
Considering the current financial crisis, the introductory offers of lenders
leave a lot to be desired, to such an extent that accepting the
standard variable rate is a feasible and sometimes rational option.
