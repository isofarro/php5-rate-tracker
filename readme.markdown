Rate tracker
============

Tracks the standard variable mortgage rate of high-street mortgage providers
to reveal who provides the long-term cheapest mortgages. The standard
variable rate is the interest rate on a mortgage once the introductory
offer period has expired right up until the end of the mortgage.

The standard variable rate of each provider is based on the Bank of England's
LIBOR rate plus a little margin. This margin seems to be from 1.4 through to
3.8 percent above the LIBOR rate. Changes to the LIBOR rate should directly
change the standard variable rate, but recently, mortgage providers are not
passing on the whole of the interest rate change.
